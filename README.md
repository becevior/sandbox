This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Mortal Kombat Feature

The project includes a Mortal Kombat themed battle animation featuring the Mariners Moose vs Oregon Duck. To make it work properly:

1. Add the following audio files to the `/public/audio/` directory:
   - `mortal-kombat-theme.mp3` - Mortal Kombat theme song
   - `fatality.mp3` - Mortal Kombat fatality sound effect

You can find these audio files from various sound effect libraries or create your own versions.
